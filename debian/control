Description: next generation Debian package upload tool
 dput-ng is a Debian package upload tool which provides an easy to use
 interface to Debian (like) package archive hosting facilities. It allows
 anyone who works with Debian packages to upload their work to a remote
 service, including Debian's ftp-master, mentors.debian.net, Launchpad or other
 package hosting facilities for Debian package maintainers.
 .
 dput-ng features many enhancements over dput, such as more comprehensive
 checks, an easy to use plugin system, and code designed to handle the numerous
 archives that any Debian package hacker will interact with.
 .
 dput-ng aims to be backwards compatible with dput in command-line flags,
 configuration files, and expected behavior.
 .
 The recommended package python-paramiko is needed to upload via SSH.
