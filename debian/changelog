dput-ng (1.6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The "Wait, what was so bad about SCP, again?" release

  Mind note to you, dear uploader of this version. Please make sure the issue
  marked with "MARK" in TODO is fixed before uploading this release.

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Implement dcut commands for Deb-o-Matic.

  [ Bernhard R. Link ]
  * Reimplement the SFTP uploader <explain details here>

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Add an --override and a --unset option to dput which overrules any
    profile key. This is an experimental option.
  * Be more precise about our configuration file inheritance in dput(5).
  * Fix "dcut: manpage and --help talk about -U and --upload" by replacing those
    parts in the text by the 'upload' command (Closes: #699812)

  [ Wolodja Wentland ]
  * Allow uploads to mentors to target every distribution

dput-ng (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Really fix #696659 by making sure the command line tool uses the most recent
    version of the library.
  * Mark several fields to be required in profiles (incoming, method)
  * Fix broken tests.
  * Do not run the check-debs hook in our mentors.d.n profile
  * Fix "[dcut] dm bombed out" by using the profile key only when defined
    (Closes: #698232)
  * Parse the gecos field to obtain the user name / email address from the local
    system when DEBFULLNAME and DEBEMAIL are not set.
  * Fix "dcut reschedule sends "None-day" to ftp-master if the delay is
    not specified" by forcing the corresponding parameter (Closes: #698719)

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Implement default_keyid option. This is particularly useful with multiple
    GPG keys, so dcut is aware of which one to use.
  * Make scp uploader aware of "port" configuration option.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hack around Launchpad's SFTP implementation. We musn't stat *anything*.
    "Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits" (Closes: #696558).
  * Rewrote the test suite to actually test the majority of the codepaths we
    take during an upload. Back up to 60%.
  * Added a README for the twitter hook, Thanks to Sandro Tosi for the bug,
    and Gergely Nagy for poking me about it. (Closes: #697768).
  * Added a doc for helping folks install hooks into dput-ng (Closes: #697862).
  * Properly remove DEFAULT from loadable config blocks. (Closes: #698157).
  * Allow upload of more then one file. Thanks to Iain Lane for the
    suggestion. (Closes: #698855).

  [ Bernhard R. Link ]
  * allow empty incoming dir to upload directly to the home directory

  [ Sandro Tosi ]
  * Install example hooks (Closes: #697767).

dput-ng (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "we're so proud of our work, we need to let everyone know" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Avoid failing on upload if a pre/post upload hook is missing from the
    Filesystem. Thanks to Moritz Mühlenhoff for the report. (Closes: #696659)
  * Adjust Homepage: to point to our spiffy debian.net alias, rather then
    my people.debian.
  * Add in experiemental clojure support via clojurepy hackery. It's
    amazingly cool, really. Thanks to Paul Tagliamonte for the extremely
    nice patch. Well done.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Fix "dcut raises FtpUploadException" by correctly initializing the uploader
    classes from dcut (Closes: #696467)

dput-ng (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Well you're smoking with the patch on." release

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  * Add bash completions for dput-ng (Closes: #695412).
    + Add bash completions for dput-ng based on traditional dput
      package.
    + Add bash-completion to Build-Depends and Recommends.
    + Use bash-completion Debhelper addon to install the bash
      completions.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hijacking the package (set maintainer to our new alioth list. Thanks,
    alioth maintainers!)
  * Add in a script to set the default profile depending on the building
    distro. (debian/rules, debian/bin/adjust-vendor)
  * Fix a bug where meta-class info won't be loaded if the config file has the
    same name.
  * Add an Ubuntu upload target. Thanks to Benjamin Drung for the
    suggestion, and Jeremy for the bug. (Closes: #695490)
  * Drop the hard dependency on validictory. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for
    the patch. (Closes: #695516)
  * Added .udeb detection to the check debs hook.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Catch the correct exception falling out of bin/dcut
  * Fix the dput manpages to use --uid rather then the old --dm flag.
  * Fix the CLI flag registration by setting required=True
    in cancel and upload.
  * Move make_delayed_upload above the logging call for sanity's sake.
  * Fix "connects to the host even with -s" (Closes: #695347)
    Arguably we did so as a design decision, but I can see how this confuses
    people. Hence, do not establish a network connection anymore using the
    -s(imulation) mode, unless -s was specified twice (-ss)
    + While I was on it, do so for -o (check-only) uploads as well
  * More distro mappings for check_protected_distributions.
