dput-ng (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Get two birds stoned at once." release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Fix up default host argument. This caused the first block with the
    default_host_main argument set to be considered the default host, rather
    than the value of default_host_main. (Closes: #729280)
  * Add experimental support for `dud` files, for Debile.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Be more explicit how to override dcut dm's UID check

 -- Paul Tagliamonte <paultag@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Nov 2013 09:20:03 -0500

dput-ng (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Well, shit, release names are hard too" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Add BYHAND handling. (Closes: #719975)
  * Change default profile to "boring" rather than "debian". This caused
    non-Debian targets to target Debian codenames.
    Which sucks. (Closes: #718384)

  [ James Page ]
  * Add in codenames for Ubuntu. (Closes: #714103)

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Fix path of local profiles in bash-completion script.
  * Install dput.commands.contrib package.
  * Add bash completion for dcut.

  * The "Command line flags are hard" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Add per-host loading of command files by partially parsing command
    line arguments.
  * Add disallowed_distributions.
  * Apply a file name heuristic to tell whether a positional is a host or a
    target (Closes: #710150).
  * Add codename groups to vital targets, limit security uploads
    to the right servers (Closes: #708575).

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Implement dcut commands for Deb-o-Matic.

  [ Bernhard R. Link ]
  * Reimplement the SFTP uploader <explain details here>

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Be more precise about our configuration file inheritance in dput(5).
  * Fix "dcut: manpage and --help talk about -U and --upload" by replacing those
    parts in the text by the 'upload' command (Closes: #699812)
  * Make the login name determination more portable (Closes: #709831)
  * Fix "Allow to give out dm permissions without using local keyring" by
  * documenting the --force option in the man page (Closes: #711057)

  [ Wolodja Wentland ]
  * Allow uploads to mentors to target every distribution

  [ Sebastian Ramacher ]
  * Add a space in --debug's help message.

  [ Thomas Preud'homme ]

dput-ng (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Wait, what was so bad about SCP, again?" release

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Really fix #696659 by making sure the command line tool uses the most recent
    version of the library.
  * Mark several fields to be required in profiles (incoming, method)
  * Fix broken tests.
  * Do not run the check-debs hook in our mentors.d.n profile
  * Fix "[dcut] dm bombed out" by using the profile key only when defined
    (Closes: #698232)
  * Parse the gecos field to obtain the user name / email address from the local
    system when DEBFULLNAME and DEBEMAIL are not set.
  * Fix "dcut reschedule sends "None-day" to ftp-master if the delay is
    not specified" by forcing the corresponding parameter (Closes: #698719)

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Implement default_keyid option. This is particularly useful with multiple
    GPG keys, so dcut is aware of which one to use.
  * Make scp uploader aware of "port" configuration option.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hack around Launchpad's SFTP implementation. We musn't stat *anything*.
    "Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits" (Closes: #696558).
  * Rewrote the test suite to actually test the majority of the codepaths we
    take during an upload. Back up to 60%.
  * Added a README for the twitter hook, Thanks to Sandro Tosi for the bug,
    and Gergely Nagy for poking me about it. (Closes: #697768).

  * allow empty incoming dir to upload directly to the home directory

  [ Sandro Tosi ]
  * Install example hooks (Closes: #697767).

dput-ng (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "we're so proud of our work, we need to let everyone know" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Avoid failing on upload if a pre/post upload hook is missing from the
    Filesystem. Thanks to Moritz Mühlenhoff for the report. (Closes: #696659)
  * Adjust Homepage: to point to our spiffy debian.net alias, rather then
    my people.debian.
  * Add in experiemental clojure support via clojurepy hackery. It's
    amazingly cool, really. Thanks to Paul Tagliamonte for the extremely
    nice patch. Well done.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Fix "dcut raises FtpUploadException" by correctly initializing the uploader
    classes from dcut (Closes: #696467)

 -- Paul Tagliamonte <paultag@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Dec 2012 09:30:06 -0500

    + Use bash-completion Debhelper addon to install the bash
      completions.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hijacking the package (set maintainer to our new alioth list. Thanks,
    alioth maintainers!)
  * Add in a script to set the default profile depending on the building
    distro. (debian/rules, debian/bin/adjust-vendor)
  * Fix a bug where meta-class info won't be loaded if the config file has the
    same name.
  * Add an Ubuntu upload target. Thanks to Benjamin Drung for the
    suggestion, and Jeremy for the bug. (Closes: #695490)
  * Drop the hard dependency on validictory. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for
    the patch. (Closes: #695516)
  * Added .udeb detection to the check debs hook.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Catch the correct exception falling out of bin/dcut
  * Fix the dput manpages to use --uid rather then the old --dm flag.
  * Fix the CLI flag registration by setting required=True
    in cancel and upload.
  * Move make_delayed_upload above the logging call for sanity's sake.
  * Fix "connects to the host even with -s" (Closes: #695347)
    Arguably we did so as a design decision, but I can see how this confuses
    people. Hence, do not establish a network connection anymore using the
    -s(imulation) mode, unless -s was specified twice (-ss)
    + While I was on it, do so for -o (check-only) uploads as well
  * More distro mappings for check_protected_distributions.
