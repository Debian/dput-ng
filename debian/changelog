  * The "Well, shit, release names are hard too" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Add BYHAND handling. (Closes: #719975)

    Which sucks. (Closes: #718384)

  [ James Page ]

    not specified" by forcing the corresponding parameter (Closes: #698719)

  [ Luca Falavigna ]
  * Implement default_keyid option. This is particularly useful with multiple
    GPG keys, so dcut is aware of which one to use.
  * Make scp uploader aware of "port" configuration option.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hack around Launchpad's SFTP implementation. We musn't stat *anything*.
    "Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits" (Closes: #696558).

    take during an upload. Back up to 60%.

  * The "we're so proud of our work, we need to let everyone know" release

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Avoid failing on upload if a pre/post upload hook is missing from the
    Filesystem. Thanks to Moritz Mühlenhoff for the report. (Closes: #696659)
  * Adjust Homepage: to point to our spiffy debian.net alias, rather then
    my people.debian.
  * Add in experiemental clojure support via clojurepy hackery. It's
    amazingly cool, really. Thanks to Paul Tagliamonte for the extremely
    nice patch. Well done.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Fix "dcut raises FtpUploadException" by correctly initializing the uploader
    classes from dcut (Closes: #696467)

    distro. (debian/rules, debian/bin/adjust-vendor)
  * Fix a bug where meta-class info won't be loaded if the config file has the
    same name.
  * Add an Ubuntu upload target. Thanks to Benjamin Drung for the
    suggestion, and Jeremy for the bug. (Closes: #695490)
  * Drop the hard dependency on validictory. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for
    the patch. (Closes: #695516)
  * Added .udeb detection to the check debs hook.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Catch the correct exception falling out of bin/dcut
  * Fix the dput manpages to use --uid rather then the old --dm flag.

    in cancel and upload.
  * Move make_delayed_upload above the logging call for sanity's sake.
  * Fix "connects to the host even with -s" (Closes: #695347)
    Arguably we did so as a design decision, but I can see how this confuses
    people. Hence, do not establish a network connection anymore using the
    -s(imulation) mode, unless -s was specified twice (-ss)
    + While I was on it, do so for -o (check-only) uploads as well
  * More distro mappings for check_protected_distributions.
