dput-ng (1.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  * Add bash completions for dput-ng (Closes: #695412).
    + Add bash completions for dput-ng based on traditional dput
      package.
    + Add bash-completion to Build-Depends and Recommends.
    + Use bash-completion Debhelper addon to install the bash
      completions.

  [ Paul Tagliamonte ]
  * Hijacking the package (set maintainer to our new alioth list. Thanks,
    alioth maintainers!)
  * Add in a script to set the default profile depending on the building
    distro. (debian/rules, debian/bin/adjust-vendor)
  * Fix a bug where meta-class info won't be loaded if the config file has the
    same name.
  * Add an Ubuntu upload target. Thanks to Benjamin Drung for the
    suggestion.

  [ Arno Töll ]
  * Catch the correct exception falling out of bin/dcut
  * Fix the dput manpages to use --uid rather then the old --dm flag.
  * Fix the CLI flag registration by setting required=True
    in cancel and upload.
  * Move make_delayed_upload above the logging call for sanity's sake.
  * Fix "connects to the host even with -s" (Closes: #695347)
    Arguably we did so as a design decision, but I can see how this confuses
    people. Hence, do not establish a network connection anymore using the
    -s(imulation) mode, unless -s was specified twice (-ss)
  * While I was on it, do so for -o (check-only) uploads as well
