Processors Walkthrough
----------------------

Processessors are just checkers, that have a few small changes. Firstly,
register as a processor, rather then a checker by placicng the plugin def
in the ``processors`` class. In the event of an error, feel free to raise
a ProcessorError.

.. XXX: ProcessorError stuff is a dirty lie.
