NAME
----
dcut - Debian archive command file upload tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dcut* [-h] [-d] [-c 'FILE'] [-m 'MAINTAINER'] [-k 'KEYID'] [-O 'FILENAME'] 
			[-P] [-s] [-U 'FILENAME'] [-i 'FILENAME'] [-v]
            ['HOST'] SUBCOMMAND ...

*dcut* ['OPTIONS'] ['HOST'] SUBCOMMAND ['SUB-COMMAND OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*dcut* can create and/or upload command files understood by the debian archive
kit ("dak") software. It provides an extensible interface so that third party
authors can easily integrate more sub-commands. Hence, your running instance of
*dcut* may understand more commands than these documented here. Refer to the 
respective documentations for these commands.

Similar to *dput*, a 'HOST' can be specified as a target site for the command
file. Likewise, the same default host selection criteria apply. 


OPTIONS
-------

*-d, --debug*::
	Enable debug messages. Repeat twice to increase the verbosity level

*-c, --config*=FILE::
	Configuration file to parse)

*-m, --maintainer*=MAINTAINER::
	Use MAINTAINER (full name and email) for the uploader field and GnuPG key 
	selection. This has no effect when --upload is used

*-k, --keyid*=KEYID::
	Use KEYID for signing. Default is to use DEBEMAIL and DEBNAME, or whatever 
	was provided with --maintainer. This has no effect when --upload is used

*-O, --output*=FILENAME::
	Write  commands  file to FILENAME  instead of uploading.  This option 
	should not be used with --upload.  FILENAME wont be overwritten if it 
	exists

*-P, --passive*::
	Use passive FTP instead of active

*-s, --simulate*::
	Simulate an upload only

*-i, --input*=FILENAME::
	(ignored)

*-v, --version*::
	Print version information and exit

*host*=HOST::
	Target host to upload a package

SUB-COMMANDS
------------

Sub-commands are actually implementing commands understood by be archive 
software. They can take individual arguments which must appear after specifying
the actual desired sub-command. 

cancel
~~~~~~

Cancel an upload entirely. The upload is referred to as a changes file name
existing *remote* in the incoming or deferred queues. 

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

Takes one argument

*FILENAME*::
	The changes file name which refers to the upload to be cancelled. 

rm
~~

Remove a lost or wrongly uploaded file from the incoming directory. The
argument is interpreted as a path fragment by the archive software. Therefore,
to delete a filename from a deferred queue, refer to it by using the full path

For example, to delete a broken upload in the DELAYED queue, use the command

  dcut rm DELAYED/X-day/foobar.deb

Alternatively, the '--searchdirs' argument instructs the archive software to
search for a file name in all directory. Hence, this command is equivalent to
the command before:

  dcut rm --searchdirs foobar.deb


Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

Takes at least one argument

*FILE*::
	The file name to be removed. This argument can be repeated, and also knows
	about the shell wildcards *, ?, and []. However, please keep your local
	shell replacements in mind when supplying shell meta characters. You may
	need to escape them or provide them within quotes.

*--searchdirs*::
	Search in all directories for the given file. Only supported for files in 
	the DELAYED queue.


dm
~~

Manage Debian Maintainer (DM) upload permissions. Debian Developers can grant
or revoke them package upload permissions using this command. Takes the Debian
Maintainer and the action to perform as argument.

Note, dcut will not perform any validation for conflicting arguments within 
*--alow* and *--deny* below. This handling is left to the archive software,
which is currently processing *--alow* before *--deny* as an implementation
detail.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

*--dm*::

Any searchable, unique identity to identify an existing Debian Maintainer. This
can be a (full) name an e-mail address or a GnuPG fingerprint of any existing
Debian Maintainer. Note, the identity must be known the the DM keyring. This
command validates the supplied argument and makes sure the identity hint 
supplied matches a *single* DM only. 

*--allow*=PACKAGES::

Source package(s) where permissions to upload should be granted. Repeat the
argument to apply permissions to more than one package at once. 

*--deny*=PACKAGES

Source package(s) where permissions to upload should be denied. Repeat the
argument to apply permissions to more than one package at once. 

reschedule
~~~~~~~~~~

Reschedule an upload. This command can move a deferred upload to any other
deferred queue.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

Takes two arguments

*FILENAME*::

file name to be rescheduled

*DAYS*::

Reschedule the upload to DAYS days. Takes a numeric argument from 0 to 15 
corresponding to the respective delayed queues. Note, 0-day is not the same
as uploading to incoming straight.


upload
~~~~~~

This is a pseudo-command (that is, it is handled within dcut and not forwarded
to the archive kit) which uploads a locally existing commands file as is.

However, no checks are performed for this file. Use with caution.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

Takes one argument

*FILENAME*::
	A local file name which is uploaded as is to the archive software.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    A runtime check returned an error
    
*2*::
    An internal error was detected, for example while loading configuration
    files

*3*::
	An upload error was detected, for example a permission or authentication
	problem while uploading files
