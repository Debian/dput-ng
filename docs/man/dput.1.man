NAME

dput - Debian package upload tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dput* [-h] [-d] [-c 'FILE'] [-D] [-e 'DAYS'] [-f] [-H] [-l] [-U] [-o] 
            [-p] [-P] [-s] [-u] [-v] [-V]
            ['HOST'] 'CHANGES-FILE'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

dput-ng is a Debian package upload tool which provides an easy to use inter-
face to Debian (like) package archive hosting facilities. It is allowing 
anyone who works with Debian packages to upload their work to a remote 
service, including Debian's ftp-master, mentors.debian.net, Launchpad or other
package hosting facilities for Debian package maintainers.

'HOST' may optionally specify a target stanza from any configured configured
profile which is selected as a upload target. If 'HOST' is omitted a default 
host using the heuristic described below is selected.

The only mandatory argument is a 'CHANGES-FILE' which is interpreted as a 
Debian +package.changes+ file denoting the desired package to be uploaded. 


Packages being uploaded already, but not processed yet can be removed later 
from the destination using *dcut*. 

OPTIONS
-------

*-c, --config*=FILE::
	Configuration file to parse. This option will override all other 
	configuration files. 

*-d, --debug*::
	Enable debug messages. Repeat twice to increase the verbosity level.

*-D, --dinstall*:: 
	Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines. 

*-e, --delayed*=DAYS::
	Upload to the delayed queue, instead of the usual incoming directory. 
	This option takes an argument from 0 to 15 correspinding to the respective
	DELAYED queue.

*-f, --force*::
	Force an upload, even if the upload log exists already.

*-H, --host-list*::
	Print out the list of hosts that dput knows about.

*-l, --lintian*::
	Run Lintian before uploading the package. Note, this option is deprecated.
	Use profiles instead. 

*-o, --check-only*::
	Only run pre-upload checks for the package, do not actually upload. 

*-p, --print*::
	This option is currently not implemented.

*-P, --passive*::
	Force FTP passive mode when uploading the package through FTP. 
	This option is deprecated - use profiles instead. 

*-s, --simulate*::
	Simulate the upload only. This runs all pre-upload checks, initializes
	the upload handler but does not actually store any file.

*-U, --no-upload-log*::
	Do not write a .upload log file after uploading.

*-u, --unchecked*::
	Do not check GnuPG signature.

*-v, --version*::
	Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines. 

*-V, --check-version*::
	Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines. 

*HOST*::
	Target host to upload a package. This refers to any existing upload site,
	which either can be a section in old-style *dput.cf* files, or
	alternatively any profile in a read *dput.d* directory.
	If *HOST* was not supplied, the (first) profile having the the 
	+default_host_main+ flag set will be selected. If neither, 'HOST' was
	present, nor any profile setting the upload host, dput-ng scans for a
	profile called 'ftp-master' which will be used on a successful look-up.

*CHANGES-FILE*::
	A Debian +package.changes+ file

PROFILES
--------

Profiles may define upload host names, log-in details and their requied upload 
methods used to upload packages. Moreover, profiles define checks which are
running before and after uploading. Its format is described in *dput.cf*(5). 

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    A runtime check returned an error
    
*2*::
    An internal error was detected, for example while loading configuration
    files

*3*::
	An upload error was detected, for example a permission or authentication
	problem while uploading files
