dput-ng
-------
Hello world
dput-ng is a from-scratch refresh of the old `dput(1)` command. This tool is
used (at some point) to aid with the act of uploading a package to an archive.

dput-ng aims to be compatible with the old `dput(1)` config files, while
adding additional features for better sanity checking, and designed in an
extensible way.

Check the [docs](http://dput.rtfd.org) for more on topics that might
