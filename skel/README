Howdy!

Firstly, thanks for trying out dput-ng.

Here's what's up with these subdirs:

Interesting stuff:
  - metas:      meta-classes for config files.
  - profiles:   where you set upload targets (ftp-master, etc)

Boring stuff:
  - checkers:   where checker routines register themselves.
  - commands:   where dcut routines register themselves.
  - interfaces: where user interface routines register themselves.
  - processors: where processor routines register themselves.
  - uploaders:  where upload routines register themselves.
  - schemas:    where the schemas for the conffiles are loaded


You should read through:

  - http://dput.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configs.html

or, if you have the dput-ng-doc package installed:

  - file:///usr/share/doc/dput-ng/html/reference/configs.html

Have fun!
