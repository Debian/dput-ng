Howdy!

Firstly, thanks for trying out dput-ng.

Here's what's up with these subdirs:

Interesting stuff:
  - metas:      meta-classes for config files.
  - profiles:   where you set upload targets (ftp-master, etc)
  - scripts:    added to sys.path, for local plugins (etc)

Boring stuff:
  - hooks:      where hook routines register themselves.
  - commands:   where dcut routines register themselves.
  - interfaces: where user interface routines register themselves.
  - uploaders:  where upload routines register themselves.
  - codenames:  list of codenames for things.
  - schemas:    where the schemas for the conffiles are loaded (/usr/share
                only)


You should read through:

  - http://dput.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configs.html

or, if you have the dput-ng-doc package installed:

  - file:///usr/share/doc/dput-ng/html/reference/configs.html

Have fun!
