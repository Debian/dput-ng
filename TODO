  $ grep -E "(TODO|XXX)" . -r

09:18 < daemonkeeper> If you're bored crossing the continent I think having a
                      critic look at checkers is more worthwhile. at least my
                      todos with checkers are a major construction site. We've
                      a stub file in there which either needs refactoring or a
                      removal, a broken checker, and a checker which only
                      exists as a quotation by me.


easy requests
-------------

  - 637775 (time in .upload files) (pinotree)
    \- we are still having the alternative to print out the log into the
       .upload file


bin/dput
--------

  - make a file logger?
  - implement --force switch (bypass all checker, ignore .upload file?)

config loader
-------------

make sure schema, scripts and other non-configs won't be attempted to be
loaded :)

tests/*
-------

  - get 100% coverage
  - test ftp / sftp w/mockers (pyftpdlib)

dput/uploader.py
----------------

  - fix shitty names
  - other misc refactors
  - change invoke_dput to a less worse name
  - same with uploader

uploader
--------

  - A progress bar
  - Authentication support


profiles
--------

  - find a sane way to allow base checks without always having to copy the
    full list in each profile. (global_checkers?)

feature requests
----------------

  - real upload progress
     (also ensure local buffer checks for ftp don't throw it off)
  - ftp control connections die without a keepalive, ensure that's right
  - check for ppa for uploads to !(ppa)
  - lack of ppa pockets, etc
  - upload to more then one ppa
  - sftp upload bar
  - Prompt before uploading to stable/security archives
    
processors
----------

  - implement the dinstall switch as a processor (possibly!)

dput-info
---------

  - Implement various switches (/-p/-v/-V) (from dput originally)
