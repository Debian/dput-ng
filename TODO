=====================

prime hacks neededing to be done

  $ grep -E "(TODO|XXX)" . -r

09:18 < daemonkeeper> If you're bored crossing the continent I think having a
                      critic look at checkers is more worthwhile. at least my
                      todos with checkers are a major construction site. We've
                      a stub file in there which either needs refactoring or a
                      removal, a broken checker, and a checker which only
                      exists as a quotation by me.


dcut
----

cancel is broken

bin/dput
--------

  - make a file logger?
  - implement dinstall switch (*sigh*) (PRT - calling a punt)
  - implement --force switch (bypass all checker, ignore .upload file?)
  - Implement various switches (-H/-U/-o/-p/-v/-V)

config loader
-------------

make sure schema, scripts and other non-configs won't be attempted to be
loaded :)

tests/*
-------

  - get 100% coverage
  - test ftp / sftp w/mockers (pyftpdlib)

dput/uploader.py
----------------

  - fix shitty names
  - other misc refactors
  - change invoke_dput to a less worse name
  - same with uploader

sftp
----

  - finish impl

uploader
--------

  - A progress bar

rsync
-----

  - implement (do people *really* use this??) - (PRT: calling a punt)

profiles
--------

  - find a sane way to allow base checks without always having to copy the
    full list in each profile. (global_checkers?)

package
-------

  - Yep, make a native Debian package out of it (that's right)
  - file an ITP (and hope the shitstorm may pass by)

feature requests
----------------

  - real upload progress
     (also ensure local buffer checks for ftp don't throw it off)
  - ftp control connections die without a keepalive, ensure that's right
  - check for ppa for uploads to !(ppa)
  - lack of ppa pockets, etc
  - upload to more then one ppa
  - sftp upload bar

dcut
----

  - Support is there, but no input validation is performed. See TODOs in
    commands/
