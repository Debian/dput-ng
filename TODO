TODO list for dput-ng
=====================

=============
CRITICAL BUGS
=============

  - default json global declares key1 to be foo
  - dput.cf [default] local declares key1 to be bar
  - key is foo, even though local dput.cf is bar

  - implement +foo -foo and =foo keys

  - fix some shitty issue with dput.core's config location not working
    exactly right.

  - "1" --> true, "0" --> false; on the fly. fucking dput.cf barfs when we
    set dputcf's default to values that aren't basestring. convert on the fly
    in dputcf, remove hacks in skel

END CRITICAL BUGS

prime hacks neededing to be done

  $ grep -E "(TODO|XXX)" . -r

bin/dput
--------

  - make a file logger?
  - implement dinstall switch (*sigh*) (PRT - calling a punt)
  - implement --force switch (bypass all checker, ignore .upload file?)
  - Implement various switches (-H/-U/-o/-p/-v/-V)

logging
-------

  - fix it, it sucks

tests/*
-------

  - get 100% coverage
  - test ftp / sftp w/mockers (pyftpdlib)

dput/uploader.py
----------------

  - fix shitty names
  - other misc refactors
  - change invoke_dput to a less worse name
  - same with uploader

sftp
----

  - finish impl
  - ports
  - behave better w/ overrides

uploader
--------

  - A progress bar

rsync
-----

  - implement (do people *really* use this??) - (PRT: calling a punt)

dput/checkers/basiscs.py
------------------------

  - add better handing of dput.cf overrides to the checks

profiles
--------

  - find a sane way to allow base checks without always having to copy the
    full list in each profile. (global_checkers?)

package
-------

  - Yep, make a native Debian package out of it (that's right)
  - file an ITP (and hope they shitstorm may pass by)

python2.6
---------

  - support it? we're close to wheezy, do we haveta?

feature requests
----------------

  - real upload progress
     (also ensure local buffer checks for ftp don't throw it off)
  - ftp control connections die without a keepalive, ensure that's right
  - check for ppa for uploads to !(ppa)
  - lack of ppa pockets, etc
  - upload to more then one ppa
  - sftp upload bar
