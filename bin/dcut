blackhole for a dcut concept:

- use the dput concept, in particular uploaders can be used as is for dcut
- checker for dcut, e.g. if a file targeted for removal actually exists in the
  queue?
- generic command support, maybe support even commands not explicitly known
  to dcut - ng?
- (How to) handle signing?

Existing commands:

rm
reschedule
cancel
dm
